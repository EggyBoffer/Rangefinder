**Rangefinder** is a lightweight Windows desktop app for pilots who need to find out if they are in range quickly!
It provides **fast, accurate jump range checks** using real in-game data via ESI, with both **automatic** and **manual** planning modes.

Works for all ships capable of using a jump drive, the automatic mode will find what ship and system you are in, what skills you have and tell you if you are currently in range!
